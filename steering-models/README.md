##Steering Models

Here you will find code and documentation for community solutions to Udacity Challenge #2: Predicting Steering Angles. The "ros-steering-node" folder includes the code we actually use on the vehicle to test models, the "community-models" folder includes information about the approaches to training and model building that the finalists used, and the "evaluation" folder includes links to the finalist models and associated scripts to test them on real image streams from the Udacity datasets.
