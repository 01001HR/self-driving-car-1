## Neural Network Evaluation Code
Massive thanks to Machine Learning wizard [Mikel Bober-Irizar (@anokas on the Udacity CarND Slack Channel)](https://github.com/mxbi)! Without him, we wouldn't have any method for evaluating how well submitted code is actually performing. He is a stellar example of the incredible community that has been built around the world's first open source self-driving car at Udacity.
